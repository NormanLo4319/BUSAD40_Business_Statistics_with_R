# BUSAD40 Business Statistics with R
Saint Mary's College of California / College of Economics and Business Administration.  
An introduction to statistical concepts used to assist in making decisions under conditions of uncertainty. Topics include the collection and analysis of data, probability and probability distributions, hypothesis testing, bivariate correlation, and linear regression analysis.

### Textbook:
This course is based on the textbook, Statistics for Business & Economics, 14e, written by Anderson, Sweeney, Williams, Camm, Cochran, Fry, and Ohlmann.

### Software:
The main statistical software package we are using in this course is "R" and the Integrated Development Environment, IDEs, "R Studio". To install R, you can find visit the [R-Project](https://www.r-project.org/) website and follow the instructions to install the software on your machine.  Once R is installed on your machine, you can visit the [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) website and follow the instructions to install the IDE on your machine. To start coding in R, we only need to start RStudio because it automatically runs the R software in the background and execute the code.
